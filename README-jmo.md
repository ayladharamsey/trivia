# SWAPI-Box

SWAPI-Box is a web application that uses the Star Wars API to tap into a “black hole” of Star Wars data. Mwahaha. 

The application loads with a login screen that allows the potential Jedi apprentice to input their name, their favorite quote and jedi level. Clicking Submit takes them to a screen populated with cards highlighting the first seven movies in the Star Wars franchise.

Selecting a movie opens a new window with scrolling text, similar to the opening scroll of the selected movie from the franchise. I also playing the wonderful soundtrack from master composer John Williams.

Clicking the "Skip Movie Stuff" or "Go to Characters" button takes you to a screen which shows the first ten characters in that movie and detailed information about them, each on their own card. It also includes an option to select your favorites from each category and display them all together on one screen.


### Learning Goals

The learning goals for this project are as follows:

- Write squeaky clean, well refactored code using ES6 syntax.
- Make informed design decisions to create a user-friendly application.
- Keep state based components to a minimum and leverage more functional components.
- Use a modular architecture for your application file structure.
- Think deeply about React Lifecycle Methods.
- Become familiar with promises, nested fetch requests, and handling the UI based on acceptance of data.
- Use propTypes for every component receiving props.
- Write tests for React components, asynchronous functionality, and route handling.
